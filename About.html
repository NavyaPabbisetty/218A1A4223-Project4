        <p><h2>And Pinch of Yum is my little corner of the internet!
           I'm the voice, author, and creator behind Pinch of Yum.
           What started as a casual hobby over 14 years ago in 2010
           while I was working as a fourth grade teacher has now grown 
           into a full-blown business (!!) that reaches millions of 
           people with fun recipes each month, with content that has
           been featured on The Kitchn, CNN, Refinery29, Brit + Co,
           POPSUGAR, Huffington Post, The Everymom, PureWow, and more.
           I live in Saint Paul, MN with my husband Bjork and our dog Sage.
           My favorite things in life are a big plate of pad Thai, sunny
           days, and going to the dog park.</h2>
           <h1>I Love Food!</h1>
           <p>In this space, I am always sharing fresh, flavorful, (mostly) 
            healthy recipes that I love to make and eat in my real, actual,
            every day life. If I wouldn’t eat it in real life, I won’t put 
            in on the blog. My goal is to inspire you with food that is
            both approachable AND exciting, whether you’re cooking for
            yourself, your family, your roommates, or your friends. I
            want you to be so excited about these recipes that you
            eagerly await 5pm when you can go home from work and 
            start cooking.On a related note, I absolutely LOVE seeing
            the food that you’re making. It will make my day if you 
            tag @pinchofyum in your Instagram photos and stories! We love
            to shout out our favorites on Fridays with our Reader Awards
            on Instagram Stories.</p>
